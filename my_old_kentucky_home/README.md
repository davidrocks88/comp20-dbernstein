My Old Kentucky Home - README
David Bernstein
COMP 20
February 25, 2016

I have completely implemented the lab to the best of my ability. 
I increased modularity by using functions and arrays rather than typing out 
        every line.
Nobody colloaborated with me on this assignment, and I spent 1 hour completing
        it.
