### Comp 20 - Assignment 3 - The Server for Historic Landmarks
### April 8, 2016

This lab took me about 15 hours to complete, and I collaborated with nobody on it. It is fully implemented, to the best of my knowledge.
I would like to thank TAs Ryan Havens, Thomas Colgrove, and Elif Kinli for helping me out with syntax and syntax-related errors.
